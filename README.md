**Project Overview** 
The commercial space industry is rapidly evolving, with companies working to make space travel more affordable and accessible. Major players such as Virgin Galactic, Rocket Lab, Blue Origin, and SpaceX are leading innovation in space transportation and satellite deployment.
Among these organizations, SpaceX has emerged as a pioneer by significantly reducing launch costs through the reusability of rocket components, particularly the Falcon 9 first stage booster. While traditional rocket launches can cost upwards of $165 million, SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 launches for approximately $62 million, largely due to its ability to recover and reuse rocket boosters.
This capstone project simulates a real-world business scenario where I assume the role of a data scientist at a fictional aerospace startup, Space Y, competing with SpaceX. The objective is to predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will successfully land and be reused, which directly impacts launch costs and competitive pricing strategies.

**Business Problem**

The cost of rocket launches depends heavily on whether the first stage booster can be recovered. If Space Y can predict booster landing success, the company can:

Estimate launch costs accurately

Improve mission planning

Enhance pricing strategies

Compete effectively in the commercial space market

**Project Objectives**

This project focuses on:

Collecting and analyzing public SpaceX launch data

Performing data wrangling and exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Building interactive dashboards to visualize launch trends

Developing machine learning models to predict first stage landing success

Evaluating model performance and identifying key predictive features

**DATASET**
Collecting data using web-scraping 

**Programming & Libraries**
Python
Pandas & NumPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn
Plotly / Dash (Dashboard Visualization)
Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning Models)
